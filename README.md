The Chimera is a homemade, high powered springer blaster which borrows many design elements from Capitan Slug's Caliburn. It features a shortened plunger tube with a larger 1.509" ID (+/- .005") to retain volume, and a draw length shortened to ~4.25". The blaster is set up to use aftermarket Longshot springs, the plunger head specifically designed for 10KG Turf, or 18.5KG Turf springs with two seperate spring seats. There are two different versions of the blaster, the Katana / Talon magwell version, and the N-strike magwell version for full length darts. There are small differences in the two models that will be annotated by either "KATANA" or "N-STRIKE".

Please note that while this blaster is assembled in a similar way to the Caliburn, every single piece is unique and no Caliburn parts / modifications will be compatible.
